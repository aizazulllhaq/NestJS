# Backend in NESTJS 

### Creating controller/module/service - done ( user )

### REST API CRUD -  done ( test with thunder client vscode ) ( user )

### dto & interfaces but without class-validator & class-transformer its not working. so we will need to install these 2 pkgs - done ( user )
## NOTE : TS only work on compile time ( coding time ) not in run time ( when server start ). so nest remove TS when run-time, so that's why we need to use class-validator & class-transformer
